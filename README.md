# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

This is a simple content-based movie recommendation system built using Python and the TMDB movies metadata dataset. It recommends movies based on plot similarity using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity.

---

## 📌 Features

- Recommend movies based on a movie you like
- Uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to compare overviews
- Simple and beginner-friendly code using Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Numpy

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- Loads movie data from a CSV file (`movies_metadata.csv`)
- Cleans and processes the movie overviews
- Uses **TF-IDF Vectorizer** to convert text into numerical form
- Calculates **cosine similarity** between movies
- Recommends the top 5 most similar movies
